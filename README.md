# portfolio524
This is my portfolio, Though I could have made it more complex using frameworks and animations. I chose to go the simple route using the basics **HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap**. This way there are no distractions. The process I was doing while working on my porfolio, I would do a commit, and push to the repo when I had to stop for the day. 

I know there are so many images for my assets, one mistake I made was not design it using either **figma or Adobe XD**. I know what I wanted yet didn't have the complete idea and did not work on the design ahead of time.

I' included the colors and fonts that I used for my porfolio as well as the font sizes.

## Colors
- #2B2B2B
- #F5F5F5
- #FFA700

## Fonts
- MacBeth 160PT
